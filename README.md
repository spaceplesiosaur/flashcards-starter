# FlashCards Game

## Abstract

This project offers a chance to practice test driven development and object-oriented programming.  It uses several classes with properties and methods to run a game in your console - it does not use HTML or CSS.

## Setup

To set up, copy this repo down to your machine and enter the root folder within your terminal.  Once there, run `node index.js`.  You should get a note in the terminal that the game has begun.

Use the arrow keys to move up and down to choose your answer.  If your answer is correct, the question will be removed from the list of questions.  If not, it will be added to the end and you will be asked again.
